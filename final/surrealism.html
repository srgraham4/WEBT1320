            <p>P1 Text. </p> 
        <p> Sample P2 Text.
            <a href="https://puppies.com/find-a-puppy/english-bulldog/tennessee" target="_blank">According to Puppies.com,</a> the average purchase cost of an English Bulldog from a reputable breeder here in the state of Tennessee is between 
    $1,500 - $3,500. I am an English Bulldog owner. Munson, my bully named the famous UGA Football announcer – Larry Munson, turned 11 years old on January 25th. I purchased him from a breeder in Georgia for $1,500. He has been living 
    on borrowed time since he was eight months old, due to complications to vaccines, surgery, and spinal malformities [unknown at birth]. Over the course of his eleven years of being my snugglebully, I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on his daily upkeep, as well as medical and emergency treatments. <a href="https://www.urbanpethospital.com/blog/post/bulldog-major-health-issues" target="_blank">The Urban Pet Hospital's Blog</a> has detailed information about all things English Bulldogs, specifying that annual Bulldog expenses can be upward of $5,000.

Despite Munson’s many psychical struggles, he is such a joy for most who meet him. We have been through a lot together – A LOT! As a domestic abuse survivor, he has been my primary emotional support with lots of snuggles, many slobbery kisses, extractions from disassociative states and a reason to LIVE!
