            <h3>What is this Movement that would have so many questionable people, situations, and terms involved?</h3>
            
            <p>According to <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/art-history/surrealism-history" target="_blank">History.com, </a>
                 the Twenty-Century Art Movement, Surrealism, “has had a lasting impact on painting, sculpture, literature, photography, and film.” [1] (History.com Editors) 
                Evolving from the Dada movement, Surrealism represented the oppressions of government, rationality, logic, dreams, or nightmares, “the uncanny, disregarded, and unconventional,” [2] 
                <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/surrealism" target="_blank"> (Tate Museum) </a>
              superstitions, fantasy, and all that was forbidden. Inspired by Sigmund Freud, these Surrealists incorporated his dream and unconsciousness theories into their art. 
                Surrealists challenged imposed societal values and norms—in search of FREEDOM—by bestowing imagery through art and writings that were pure juxtapose. “With the absence of all 
                control exercised by reason, aesthetics, and morals, the movement’s artists discover enchantment and unusual beauty in the unexpected, the unsettling, the outlandish, and the 
                unorthodox.” [3] <a href="https://www.artchive.com/art-movements/surrealism/" target="_blank"> (Artchive.com)</a>
                A literal revolution. With all that was occuring during this time period, World Wars I and II, the rise of Communism, Anti-Semitisism and Facisism, it can easily be assumed that these artists sought to create a  new kind of reality to make sense of the world. These revoluntists, or “avant-garde artists, endured public ridule both in Europe and America, suffered political persecution in Germany. The most dramatic example of this persecution was the infamous 
                <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/entartete-kunst-the-nazis-inventory-of-degenerate-art" target="_blank"> Entartete Kunst [4]</a> exhibition, which attracted more than two 
                million local vistors and another million traveling visitors by the end of its four months.”[5] 
                <a href="https://www.cengage.com/c/gardner-s-art-through-the-ages-16e-kleiner/9781337630702/" target="_blank">(Cengage.com)</a>
                 Some of these artists had art 
                 confiscated or burned, were exiled from their homelands, jailed, treated so harshly that they committed suicide, and even ordered to be executed.[INSERT CITATIONS]

        <h3>So, how did this unrealistic Art movement begin? </h3>
           <p>It “officially” began in Paris with a trained psychiatrist, <a href="https://www.theartstory.org/artist/breton-andre/" target="_blank">André Breton</a>, who was a Dada [7] (Artland Magazine) poet, when he wrote his first Surrealist Manifesto in 1924. Unofficially, 
            the movement originated as early as 1917, with the juxtaposing [contradictory] artworks of Giorgio de Chirico. [8] (Christie's) While Chirico, an Italian author and artist, was NOT a Surrealist, 
        his “images 
            transcended their physical appearances;” his Metaphysical Painting movement (Kleiner) impacted German Dadaist, <a href="//www.max-ernst.com" target="_blank">Max Ernst</a>, [9] (Max-Ernst.com) 
            even after Chirico had forsaken that style. Also in 1917, in the introduction to the ballet, “Parade” the French avant-garde poet, Guillaume Apollinaire, created the term 
            “surrealist” which translates “beyond reality.” (Artchive.com)</p></p>

        <p>
        As the Dada movement was ending, Ernst took this inspiration with him when he moved to Paris in 1922. “The disorientating illogic of Ernst’s collages fueled Breton’s imagination as he 
        became more entrenched in Sigmund Freud’s ideas.” (History.com Editors)  Breton, along with three other French poets, were intoxicated by Freud’s psychological theories and dream studies, 
        as well as the political ideas of Karl Marx. The Met’s, James Voorhies, articulated it best when he wrote that the group “used Freudian methods of free association, their poetry and 
        prose drew upon the private world of the mind, traditionally restricted by reason and societal limitations, to produce surprising, uexpected 
        imagery. The cerebral and irrational tenets of Surrealism find their ancestry in the clever and whimsical disregard for tradition fostered by Dadaism a decade earlier.” [10] (Voorhies) </p>
