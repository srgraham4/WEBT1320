            <p>He had a very weird fascination with Hitler. Yes, THE HITLER!</p>
          <p> He spent time with Elvis Presley, John Lennon, David Bowie, Pablo Picasso, Sigmund Freud and Alice Cooper. He even turned Cooper into a hologram! Check out gruenemann's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVhi7gi7_OA" target="_blank"> video of the hologram!</a>

Giraffe-skin vests, a diamond tierra and necklace, entrouage entrance and his surrealism.  </a></p>  
          <img src="images/cooper_dali.jpeg" alt=""Cooper and Dali">
           <p>He believed he was his dead brother's <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/the-art-genome-project-what-you-need-to-know-about-salvador-dali" target="_blank"> reincarnation</a> and that his parent's only loved his brother's soul and not him. Well, he was named Salvador Dalí. </p>
            <p> According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8107580/Movember-poll-finds-Salvador-Dali-had-most-famous-moustache.html" target="_blank">The Telegraph,</a> his mustache was voted "best-known moustache of all time."</p>
           <p>Dalí had an unusual marriage. In August 1929, he met the love of his life: Gala. Unfortunately, Gala was already married to the French surrealist poet 
            <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/paul-eluard" target="_blank">  Paul Eluard.</a>
             Dali wasn't discouraged, since Gala and Eluard had what we might now term 
            an "open marriage" with the artist 
            <a href=" https://www.max-ernst.com" target="_blank">  Max Ernst.</a>
           After divorcing Eluard (although they apparently continued a sexual relationship), Gala married Dali in 1934. They would remain together until her death in 1982.
            While it wasn't exactly a traditional marriage, another open  marriage, the relationship was apparently a happy one. 
            Gala became Dali's muse and business manager, her financial shrewdness supporting his extravagant lifestyle. 
            The partnership was so important that Dali would frequently sign art with both of their names. 
            In 1968, Dali bought Gala a castle in Spain, which she accepted ON THE CONDITION that he could only visit her there after obtaining HER WRITTEN PERMISSION!</p>

            <a href="https://www.fridakahlo.org/frida-kahlo-facts.jsp" target="_blank">Frida Kahlo</a>
            <p>She became a painter after a near fatal accident. She suffered multiple fractures of her spine, collarbone and ribs, a shattered pelvis, broken foot and a dislocated shoulder. In her lifetime, she had 30 operations.</p>
            <p>She is known as the master of Self-Portraits. In her career, Frida Kahlo created 143 paintings out of which 55 are self-portraits.</p>
            <p>Her face is on the 500 Mexican peso bill; the other side is her husband, Diego Rivera.</p>
            <img src="images/frida-peso.jpeg" alt="Fride on 500 Peso">
            <p> According to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120679/" target="_blank">IMDb</a>, Frida Kahlo's niece was so impressed with the film that she gave <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000161/" target="_blank"> Salma Hayek</a> one of her necklaces.</p></ul>
            <p>Frida Kahlo was a bisexual. Her marriage with Rivera was tumultuous with both having multiple affairs. Frida had affairs with both men and women. Frida knew Diego was a serial adulter before she married him, but his affair with Kahlo's younger sister, Cristina, infuriated her. They divorced in 1939 but remarried a year later. Although their second marriage was as troubled as the first, Kahlo remained married to Rivera till her death.</p>
